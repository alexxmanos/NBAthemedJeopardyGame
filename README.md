# NBAthemedJeopardyGame

For my first project I created a NBA Jeopardy Game displays that a jeopardy like game board with questions that are NBA related. This game was built using HTML,CSS,and JavaScript.

CSS was used to make the jeopardy game board and style it.

JavaScript was used to add functions, eventListeners and the arrays for the questions and answers.

HTML was used to link my CSS and JavaScript File

# Requirements

A win state - a way for the player to win the game

A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game

Flexbox

# How To Play

Open index.html in your web broswer 

The jeopardy gameboard is a 5x5 grid. A player can pick a number 100-500 and a question will appear and three multiple choice answers will appear.

With each increasing number that a player picks the question gets harder. The smaller the number, the easier the question.

If the player picks the right question the points will be added to their score and the background of the card will turn green

If the player picks the wrong question no points will be added to their score and the background of the card will turn red. 

# Technologies Used

# Improvements

Add a timer and have a set time in which the player has a time limit to answer the question just like real jeopardy

Add the jeopardy theme music and sound effects

Add mutiple players/teams

# Challenges 

Had a hard time getting the text for the multiple choice answers to show. They were just blank buttons.

Had small minor mistakes for example had a problem where a player clicked the correct answer and the answer was wrong.
